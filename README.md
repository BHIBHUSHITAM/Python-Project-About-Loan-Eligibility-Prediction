## LOAN ELIGIBILITY PREDICTION 

Loan Eligibility Prediction: A Python Machine Learning Approach

🏦 Project Synopsis: I’ve developed a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility, harnessing Python’s analytical power. This project aims to streamline the loan approval process, providing quick and reliable predictions.

🔍 Project Insights:

Dataset: Utilized the Bank Marketing Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, rich with customer demographics and campaign outcomes.

EDA: Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the factors influencing loan approval.

Modeling Techniques: Addressed class imbalance with reweighing and undersampling, ensuring fair predictions across diverse customer profiles.

📈 Key Observations:

Higher subscription rates among students and single clients.

Notable subscription trends based on education level and previous campaign history.

🛠️ Tools & Methodology:

Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and model building.

Visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate findings.

📚 Source & License: Inspired by research and datasets available in public domain, this project is released under the MIT License, encouraging open use and collaboration.
